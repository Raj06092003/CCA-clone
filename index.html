    <h2>About CCA!</h2>
    <h3>CCA, Centre for Cognitive Activities, is the focal point where convergence of all technical and scientific endeavours of the students materialises. This club is the revolution which bridges the gap between knowledge and application. Bulk of the extracurricular activities held in the college all the year round are organised by the CCA , with the objective of probing the dark recesses of human mind so that the grey cells are stimulated to create , conceptualise and evolve, triggering a rebellion of the new age mind against baseless conventions and meek acceptance.</h3>

                   <h3>Aarohan means to conquer greater heights. As the annual Techno Management festival of NIT Durgapur, it dares one to elevate his limits and to defy one's capacity. This year, yet again, they celebrate technology with a hope to explore that minuscule thing that always eludes us - perfection. Aarohan hosts a galaxy of events aimed at boosting the technological and managerial skills inherent in today's youth and providing them with an opportunity to showcase their innovative ideas and thoughts.</h3>

                    Creation of automated machines which mimic and reproduce human behaviour, has been the topic of enthusiastic research for ages. With the recent ground-breaking advances in electronics science and programming technology, research and development in the field of producing high- precision, highly efficient robots is the latest trend. There is no such field, be it military, commercial or domestic where robotics does not find an application. To keep pace with the lightning speed at which the rest of the world is producing advances in robotics, we at Robo Cell, try to inculcate, nurture and support the spirit of robot-making from a rudimentary level to expertise. Unlike the many mundane media of imparting knowledge, we believe hands-on experience to be the best one to acquire experience. Thus, we arrange for workshops on basic mechanical/wired robotics, where the art of robot making is taught from scratch. In collaboration with guest institutes, we also provide professional-level robotics ‘gyaan’. Besides workshops, we also prepare events pertaining to hard-core robotics that not only serve the competitive spirit in robot-making but also add to the fun and trivia quotient. Every year we witness hundreds of enthusiastic out-station participants.</h4>

Research and Development (R&D) flourishes where young minds and experienced faculties work synergistically. R&D Cell has been established to promote and monitor the research Programs of the institute. The cell administers all the research Programs of the university by monitoring and coordinating the research Programs.The Research and Development Cell aims to nurture research culture in the College by promoting research in newly emerging and challenging areas of Engineering, Technology, Science and Humanities. Faculty and students have been encouraged to be creative, since it is the creative aspect that induces newer thinking. Lectures and demonstration are made for students to kindle their spirit of creativity by our own faculty and other experts along with paper presentation and workshop.</h4>

                <h4>Rules and norms are there, meant to be followed, for the smooth pliability of social wagons. And then there is imagination. Imagination is a strange thing. It is wild, it is silly. It is the fuel to all great revolutionaries that have taken place in the history of the world. Every human is entitled with this special gift. To imagine, to be free. Free to make our own choices. Free to shape ourselves. As children, imagination comes to us as naturally as breathing. As a child, we aren't afraid to become Superman or Miss Universe. As grown-up's, we all know what would happen if we declared in public that we would like to become Superman! Imagination dies a natural death along with childhood. An Entrepreneur differs from us in this very aspect. He isn't ashamed of his big, silly plans. He isn't afraid to fail or tired of getting up. He never stopped imagining. An entrepreneur is a leader, a driving force behind semiconscious process of intuition and insight, rooted in experience. Every successful entrepreneur has been a person who was able to identify the problem and come up with a solution to it before someone else did. An entrepreneur develops this vision and a strategy of how to implement it.</h4>
